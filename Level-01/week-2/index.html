               <p>Hi, I am Anran Yu, you can call me Ann. I am from China. Now I live in Ottawa.I came to Canada in January this year and started my <abbr title="English for Academic Purposes">EAP</abbr> course. I finished the course at the end of April. And I started my major course in September this year. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> year in <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>. My major is <em>Interactive Media Design</em>. I am so glad to study with all of you.Although we cannot study and communicate face to face, I am looking forward to meeting you as soon as possible and I believe we will have a good two years together.</p>
               <p>I like to sing. I used to be a singer in a Chinese bar. But in the future, I want to be a good <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> designer. I hope to use what I've learned to get a good job and have a house of my own in Ottawa. Yes, I want to stay in Ottawa. Because in this year, I fell in love with Ottawa, I like the snow in winter and the maple leaves in autumn.</p>
